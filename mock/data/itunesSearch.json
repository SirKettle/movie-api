      "longDescription": "Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.",

      "longDescription": "We live for the pursuit of the unknown. The anticipation of what the future holds. The untapped potential of what lies ahead. The finish line is only a starting point for a new adventure. What happens in between is where the real action is. Our mission is to document the future of mountain biking as it unfolds in real time. We capture the true lifestyle that intersects our lives as professional mountain bikers, builders and filmmakers, concocting a unique chemistry of filmic goodness. Many past films, riders, and locations have inspired us. Some of those locations are now our backyards, and some of those riders are now our friends. From the Inside Out is our adventure to the places we've always wanted to ride, and our expression of the lines and styles that have influenced us. This is freeride mountain biking. This film is from us – the riders. Written, directed and edit by The Coastal Crew and produced by Anthill Films, From the Inside Out was filmed entirely in British Columbia, the birthplace of freeride, and features some of the world's best freeriders."

      "longDescription": "Anton Corbijn is one of the most versatile and authoritative visual artists in popular culture of the past thirty years. He has had a vast influence on what defines fame and artistry in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.Initially as a photographer, he played a large role in building the image of artists such as Joy Division, U2 and Depeche Mode. He also contributed to the redefinition of the iconography of artists like The Rolling Stones and Metallica for a new generation.Inside Out examines Anton’s youth and current life and, in doing so, searches for the source and meaning of the themes in his life and work: sacrifice, fame, religion and death. This documentary shows what drives him and what his ideas are on the modern icons that he has created. For the first time Corbijn has granted full access to his life and reveals how he sees himself. He exposes his character and work method through critical and comprehensible interviews with, among others, Bono, Herbert Grönemeyer, Lou Reed and Metallica. The result is an intimate and revealing portrait of a quintessential artist of postmodern pop culture."

Travel the globe with French artist JR as he motivates entire communities to define their most important causes with incredibly passionate displays of giant black and white portraits pasted in the street. We witness young and old taking ownership of walls that were previously restricted and in doing so testing the limits of what they thought was possible. In capturing the process, Alastair Siddons creates a glowing testament to the power of image and the role that art can play in transforming communities."

      "longDescription": "This critically acclaimed film, by Oscar-nominee Daniel Anker, is a filmic exploration of the magic and mystery of music through the stories, passion, and artistry of the 105 musicians of The Philadelphia Orchestra, in their first film appearance since Disney's Fantasia.  An exuberant crowd-pleaser, the movie is a feast of sound — with jazz, bluegrass, salsa, classical and world music interwoven with the musicians’ personal stories, each of which has at its core the universal struggle for self-expression.   Nominated for the International Documentary Association’s Distinguished Feature Award, and winner of the Parents’ Choice Silver Award."

      "longDescription": "Niall Horan first rose to fame in 2010 when he auditioned as a solo artist on the British X factor. His X Factor journey led him on a path that would see him become a member of the boy band One Direction. He quickly established himself as a fan favourite as One Direction started to become a global phenomena.
